# Covid_Data_Analysis
In this project I used SQL to do some basic exploratory data analysis on covid data across the world. I used Alex The Analyst's github repo to download the data. Perfomed different explorations in the data and wrote several queries in SQL to extract hidden features and data meaning in it.
